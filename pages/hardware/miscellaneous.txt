| [[http://www.rowetel.com/wordpress/?page_id=3902|SM1000 FreeDV Adaptor]]  | The SM1000 allows you to run FreeDV without a PC. Connect the SM1000 to your SSB radio, and you now have Digital Voice (DV). You don’t have to buy a new radio to run Digital Voice! It’s based on a STM32F4 micro-controller, has a built in microphone, speaker amplifier, speaker, and transformer isolated interfaces to your radio. It’s just 80 x 100mm, and can be held in you hand and used like a regular PTT microphone. Or it can sit on your bench and work with your favourite headset.  | ?        |
