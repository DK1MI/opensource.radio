QRSS is the ultra-narrowband "semi-digital" mode in ham radio: Very slow Morse code with 3 to 60 seconds dot lengths are sent with low power transmitters and "read" from a slow moving spectrum screen. Further information can be found e.g. at https://qrss.org/

Much of the software typically used both to transmit and receive QRSS is open source:
