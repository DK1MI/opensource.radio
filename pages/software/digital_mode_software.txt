| [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/fldigi/|Fldigi]]   | free and open-source program which allows an ordinary computer's sound card to be used as a simple two-way data modem. The software is mostly used by amateur radio operators who connect the microphone and headphone connections of an amateur radio SSB or FM transceiver to the computer's headphone and microphone connections, respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | C                        | ?         | Win/Mac/Linux        |
| [[https://wsjt.sourceforge.io/wsjtx.html|WSJT-X]]     | WSJT-X ("Weak Signal Communication, by K1JT") offers specific digital protocols optimized for EME (moonbounce), meteor scatter, and ionospheric scatter, at VHF/UHF, as well as for LF, MF, and HF propagation.  The program can decode fraction-of-a-second signals reflected from ionized meteor trails and steady signals more than 10 dB below the audible threshold.  WSJT-X incorporates nearly all popular capabilities of the former programs WSJT and WSPR, while adding comprehensive rig control and many other features.  Check the WSJT-X page and links therein for details about modes FT4, FT8, FST4, FST4S, JT4, JT9, JT65, Q65, MSK144, and WSPR.  | Fortran, Python, C++, C  | GPLv3     | Win/Mac/Linux        |
