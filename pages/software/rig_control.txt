| **[[https://groundstation.sourceforge.net/grig/|GNOME RIG / Grig]]**  | Grig is a simple Ham Radio control (CAT) program based on the Ham Radio Control Libraries (Hamlib). It is intended to be highly generic presenting the user to the same graphical user interface regardless of which radio is being controlled. Grig supports the most commonly used CAT commands that are implemented by Hamlib, and integrates well with other ham radio programs like Xlog and gMFSK. Thanks to Hamlib, grig works with most CAT-capable amateur radios. You can check out the Supported Radios page at the Hamlib website.  | C         | GPL                         | Linux          |

Features: multi-threading (multiple programs, written by different authors in different languages, can control the radio via Omni-Rig at the same time); external rig description files (the support of a new rig model can be implemented just by creating an ini file that describes the CAT commands of the radio)                                                                                                                                                                     | PASCAL    | Mozilla Public License 2.0  | Windows        |
