It offers a flexible and powerful platform to create custom radio systems and understand how they work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | C++, Python  | GPLv3        | Windows, Linux, Mac           |

Quisk rhymes with "brisk", and is QSK plus a few letters to make it easier to pronounce. QSK is a Q signal meaning full breakin CW, and Quisk has been designed for low latency CW operation. It works fine for SSB and AM too. Quisk is written in Python and C, and all source is included so you can change it yourself. The Quisk receiver can read the sample data, tune it, filter it, demodulate it, and send the audio to the sound card for output to external headphones or speakers. The Quisk transmitter can accept microphone input and send that to your transmitter via a soundcard or Ethernet.  | Python       | GPLv2        | Windows, Linux, Mac           |
