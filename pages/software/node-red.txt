====== Node-RED ======
Below is the main Node-RED information. This is the first step in building your own Node-RED programming environment.

| [[https://nodered.org/|Node-RED]]  | Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways. It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette that can be deployed to its runtime in a single-click.  | Javascript  | OpenJS Foundation  | Mac/Win/Linux  |

Nodes are used to create functionality within your Node-RED flows. Below are some of the most commonly used nodes for Amateur Radio operators.
