====== Typical Pluto+ Setup ======

Two common QO-100 setups are via a Pluto+ (or Adalm Pluto, but if you're buying one specifically you might as well get a the Pluto+) or via up/down converters using a 2/70cm SSB capable radio, e.g. IC-705 together with a SDR reciever. 

This diagram has my callsign on it, but it's not my design, I just drew it. Also includes my estimates of the power. In operation I've found I'm at 85% in SDR console, which I think is circa 10-12W out, and I'm similar signal strength to the centre beacon. I've spoken to others with 1.2-1.8m dishes and they use 2-5W.

===== Bill of Materials =====

This is based in UK in 2023. Some optimisation possible. Dish/coax is probably overpriced.

===== Software =====

If you run Windows you might as well use [[https://www.sdr-radio.com/console|SDR Console]], particularly for the geobeacon frequency locking. See their [[https://www.sdr-radio.com/EsHail-2|docs]]. However, as you're on [[:start|opensource.radio]] then you probably won't be running Windows LOL, so check out alternatives on [[software:sdr_software|here]].
