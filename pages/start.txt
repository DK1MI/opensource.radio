====== Open Source in Amateur Radio ======

Welcome to the Open Source in Amateur Radio wiki! This resource is dedicated to providing information about **open-source software** and **hardware** as well as **free home-brew projects** for amateur radio enthusiasts. The idea of this website or wiki is to give a (future) radio amateur an overview of all available open source projects. The aim is to promote the use of open source software and hardware in amateur radio. Depending on personal requirements, it is now possible to set up an amateur radio station whose main components are open source.
